# Activities

## Overview

This repository is for storing all of your class activities. Each activity that
you do in class will contribute to your overall participation grade. There is no
grading scheme for class activities. I will simply check that the activity was
turned in at the end of the class period, and that you have made an effort to do
the activity as intended, and figures are showing.

If the activity is not turned in at the end of the class period, then it will not
be counted toward your participation grade.

As a reminder, your participation grade is also impacted by your use of Discord.
Please don't be shy about putting a question in the chat, or answering a question
from a colleague.

## Saving

I would recommend a workflow of `Copy to Drive --> editing/running/testing --> downloading`.
You should have already hit `Copy to Drive`, but if you haven't, then please do
so before adding your activity back to this repository. 

Verify that the name of the file is the original name (e.g. data_distortion_activity.ipynb)

Next, download the file from the menu at the top of the Colab interface.
File > Download > Download ipynb

If you are satisfied with your work, you can now upload the downloaded file to
this repo!

- Next to the green code button in GitHub, you will see an `add file` button.
  Click that, then choose the downloaded notebook from your computer.
- Make sure that you are selecting the correct file.
- Please only upload one file per activity. If you upload the wrong thing, please
  remove it and upload the correct file

Overtime, you will have a record of all of your work here here in GitHub.
